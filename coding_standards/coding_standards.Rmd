## Coding Standards for R

1. Always use text files/text editor
2. Indent your code
3. Limit the width of your code (80 columns?)
4. Limit the size of your functions

## Indenting 

* Improves readability
* Fixing line length prevents lots of nesting and very long functions
* Suggested: indents of 4 spaces minimum; 8 spaces ideal
