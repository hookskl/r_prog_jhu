## Data Frames

Data frames are used to store tabular data

* They are represented as a special type of list where every element of the list has to have the same length
* Each element of the list can be thought of as a column and the length of each element of the list is the number of rows
* Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column (just like lists); matrices must have every element be the same class
* Data frames also have a special attribute called `row.names`
* Data frames are usually created by calling `read.table()` or `read.csv()`
* Can be converted to a matrix by calling `data.matrix()`, just be mindful this will result in coercion.

```{r}
x <- data.frame(foo = 1:4, bar = c(T, T, F, F))
print(x)
print(nrow(x))
print(ncol(x))
```
