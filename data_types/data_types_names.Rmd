## Names

R objects can also have names, which is very useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
print(names(x))
names(x) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")
print(x)
print(names(x))
```

Lists can also have names.

```{r}
x <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
x
```

And matrices.

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
dimnames(m) <- list(c("a", "b"), c("c", "d"))
m
```
