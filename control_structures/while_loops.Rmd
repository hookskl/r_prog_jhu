## while

`while` loops begin by testing a condition. If it is `TRUE` then they execute the loop body. Once the loop body is executed, the condition is tested again, repeating the loop until the condition returns `FALSE`.

```{r}
count <- 0
while(count < 10) {
  print(count)
  count <- count + 1
}
```

Worth nothing that `while` loops can run indefinitely if not written carefully.

Sometimes there will be more than one condition in the test.

```{r}
z <- 5

while(z >= 3 && z <= 10) {
  print(z)
  coin <- rbinom(1, 1, 0.5)
  
  if(coin == 1) { ## random walk
    z <- z + 1
  } else {
    z <- z - 1
  }
}
```

Conditions are always evaluated from left to right.
