## Matrices

Matrices are vectors with a *dimension* attribute. The dimension attribute is itself an integer vector of length 2 (nrow, ncol).

```{r}
m <- matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
print(m)
print(dim(m))
print(attributes(m))
```

Matrices are constructed *column-wise*, so entrices can be thought of starting in the "upper left" corner and running down the columns.

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
m
```

Matrices can also be created directly from vectors by adding a dimension attribute.

```{r}
m <- 1:10
print(m)
dim(m) <- c(2, 5)
print(m)
```

## cbing-ing and rbind-ing

Matrices can be created by *column-binding* or *row-binding* with `cbind()` and `rbind()`.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- 10:12
print(cbind(x, y))
print(rbind(x, y))
```
