## Random Sampling

The `sample` function draws randomly from a specified set of (scalar) objects allowing you to sample form arbitray distributions.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
sample(1:10, 4) # sample 4 objects from the vector 1 to 10, without replacement
sample(1:10, 4)
sample(letters, 5)
sample(1:10) # permutation
sample(1:10)
sample(1:10, replace = TRUE) # sample w/replacement
```
