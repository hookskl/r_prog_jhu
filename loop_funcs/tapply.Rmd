```

## tapply

`tapply` is used to apply a function over subsets of a vector. In this case the name isn't conducive to how the function operates.

```{r}
str(tapply)
```


* `X` is a vector
* `INDEX` is a factor or a list of factors (or else they are coerced to factors)
* `FUN` is a function to be applied
* `...` contains other arguments to be passed to `FUN`
* `simplify` logical whether result should be simplified

Take group means.

```{r}
x <- c(rnorm(10), runif(10), rnorm(10, 1))
f <- gl(3, 10)
f
tapply(x, f, mean)
```

Find group ranges.

```{r}
tapply(x, f, range)
```
