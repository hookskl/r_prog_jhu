## mapply

`mapply` is a multivariate apply of sorts. It applies a function in parallel over a set of arguments.

```{r}
str(mapply)
```
* `FUN` is a function to be applied
* `...` contains arguments to apply over
* `MoreArgs` is a list of other arguments to `FUN`
* `SIMPLIFY` indicates whether the result should be simplified

Something very tedious to type, `list(rep(1, 4), rep(2, 3), rep(3, 2), rep(4, 1)`, could instead be written as:

```{r}
mapply(rep, 1:4, 4:1)
```

## Vectorizing a Function

```{r}
noise <- function(n, mean, sd) {
  rnorm(n, mean, sd)
}

noise(5, 1, 2)
noise(1:5, 1:5, 2) # doesn't give desired result
```

## Instant Vectorization

```{r}
mapply(noise, 1:5, 1:5, 2)
```

The power of this is a function that doesn't normally take vectors as an input can be used in a way that does.
