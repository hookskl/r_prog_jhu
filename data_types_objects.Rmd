## Objects

R has five basic or "atomic" classes of objects:

* character
* numeric (real numbers)
* integer 
* complex
* logical (True/False)

The most basic object is a vector

* A vector can only contain objects of the *same* class
* **BUT**: The one exception is a *list*, which is represented as a vector but can contain objects of different classes (indeed, that's usually why we use them)

Empty vectors can be created with the `vector()` function.
