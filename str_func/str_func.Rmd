```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## str: Compactly display the internal structure of an R object

* A diagnostic function and an alternative to `summary`
* It is especially well suited to compactly display the (abbreviated) contents of (possibly nested) lists
* Roughly one line per basic object

This is all for the capability to best answer: **What's in this object?**

## Some examples

Looking at some functions in R:

```{r}
str(str)
str(lm)
```
Also useful for looking at data.

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100, 2, 4)
str(x)
```
