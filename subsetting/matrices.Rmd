## Subsetting a Matrix

Matrices can be subsetted in the usual way with $(i,j)$ type indices.

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x[1, 2]
x[2, 1]
```

Indices can also be missing.

```{r}
x[1, ]
x[, 2]
```

By default, when a single element of a matrix is retrieved, it is returned as a vector of length 1 rather than a $1\times1$ matrix. This behavior can be turned off by setting `drop = FALSE`.

```{r}
x[1, 2]
x[1, 2, drop = FALSE]
```

Similarly, subsetting a single column or a single row will give you a vector, not a matrix (by default).
