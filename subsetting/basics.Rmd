## Subsetting

There are a number of operators that can be used to extract subsets of R objects.

* `[` always returns an object of the same class ase the original; can be used to select more than one element (there is one exception)
* `[[` is used to extract elements of a list or a data frame; it can only be used to extract a single element and the class of the returned object will not necessarily be a list or data frame
* `$` is used to extract elements of a list or data frame by name; semantics are similar to that of `[[`

```{r}
# numerical indexing
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "a")
x[1]
x[2]
x[1:4]

# logical indexing
x[x > "a"]
# create a logical vector for indexing
u <- x > "a"
u
x[u]

```
