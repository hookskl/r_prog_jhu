## Removing NA Values

A common task is to remove missing values (`NA`s). A simple a approach to this is create a logical vector using `is.na` and then subsetting the data.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 5)
bad <- is.na(x)
x[!bad]
```

What if there are multiple things and you want to take the subset with no missing values?

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA, 5)
y <- c("a", NA, NA, "d", NA, "f")
good <- complete.cases(x, y)
good

x[good]
y[good]

```

Note the behavior of `complete.cases` above, where if only one corresponding element from the two vectors is missing then it considers this to be an "incomplete" case.
