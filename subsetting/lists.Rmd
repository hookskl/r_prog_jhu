## Subsetting Lists

```{r}
x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6)
x[1]
x[[1]]
x$bar
x[["bar"]]
x["bar"]
```


Getting multiple elements from a list:

```{r}
x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = 0.6, baz = "hello")
x[c(1, 3)]
```

The `[[` operator can be used with *computed* indices; `$` can only be used with literal names.

```{r}
name <- "foo"
x[[name]] ## computed index for `foo`
x$name
x$foo
```
## Subsetting Nested Elements of a List

The `[[` can take an integer sequence. This works the same as double subsetting.

```{r}
x <- list(a = list(10, 12, 14), b = c(3.14, 2.81))
x[[c(1,3)]]
x[[1]][[3]]
```
